# Conway's Game of Life

A version of Conway's Game of Life implemented in Java with JavaFX. Has a number of helpful features including play/pause button, advance one generation button, clear simulation button, variable game speed, a resisable game grid and buttons to insert a number of interesting example machines. The game runs smoothly at 60fps and has a virtually infinite grid size although it does tend to slow down with more taxing simulations.
