## About

A simple clone of the dinosaur jumping game that appears when you have no internet in Chrome. Designed it to be used with an Arduino acting as a motion controller which you have to physically lift to make the dinosaur jump. Also included a button on the controller to navigate through the game's menus and a buzzer that plays sound effects and a little jingle when you lose the game. Programmed the game in Processing and the Arduino code in C, designed the Arduino circuit in Fritzing and a basic 3d-printable case for the Ardunio in OpenSCAD.
