# DinoJump

A simple clone of the dinosaur jumping game that appears when you have no internet in Chrome. Designed it to be used with an Arduino controller with simple motion controls which you have to physically lift to make the dinosaur jump. Also included a button on the controller to navigate through the game's menus and a buzzer that plays a little jingle when you lose the game. Programmed the game in Processing and the Arduino in C, designed the Arduino circuit in Fritzing and a simple 3d-printable case for the Ardunio in OpenSCAD.
