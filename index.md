# Hi there

I'm Ashley, a 4th-year undergraduate student studying Mathematical Computation at University College London. I love programming and software development, in particular game development. I've dabbled in a lot of programming languages but my main ones are C++ and JavaScript. You can see some of the work and projects I've done below.
