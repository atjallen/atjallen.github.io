## About

- Developed a C++ tool to convert FBX files to a JSON asset format based on an existing tool that converted from the DAE format
	- Analysed the specifications of the asset format and existing tool to translate these to the new tool
	- Designed the new tool to be as fast as the old one and produce assets 10% smaller in some cases
	- Gained an in-depth understanding of areas of modelling including meshes, skeletons and animations
	- Updated the Python asset compile process for the Boundless game to use the new tool
- Added a feature to the Boundless game whereby some creatures would float and play special animations in water and lava instead of sinking to the bottom and drowning as they previously had been
	- Gained an understanding of one way animations, entity actions and entity AI states can be linked in a game as well as how a component system works
