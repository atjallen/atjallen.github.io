## About

Worked as a full-stack developer on the companyâ€™s core product, a web app and accompanying API which enables conveyancers to perform ID checks on their clients to faciliate onboarding. Was responsible for developing major product features, fixing bugs, performing code reviews and participating in weekly planning and retrospective sessions. Had the opportunity to research, plan and start to implement a major infrastructure change where backend features were moved to a separate microservice written in Go and communication was performed via a Kafka queue.
