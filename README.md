## Hi there

I'm Ashley, a 3rd year undegraduate student studying Mathematical Computation at University College London. I absolutely *love* programming and I'm quite partial to a bit of maths too. I've dabbled in a lot of different programming languages but my main ones are JavaScript and Java (I sense a pattern forming...). I've also done stuff in Go, C, C++, Python and Haskell. I've gotten good results in my course so far (fingers crossed). I also really love video games, playing them and making them.
